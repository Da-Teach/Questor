June 26, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor (PoorNewb23):
	 - Added 20 sec delay to questor startup in order to avoid case where Questors attempts to login before EVE managed to establish server connection
	 - Added per mission's pocket custom orbit distance setting; 
		* use <orbitdistance>5000</orbitdistance> for each pocket, in same place where you put <damagetype>
		* when no orbit distance is specified for given pocket, Questor will use the value from charname.xml file

June 10, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Fixed bug in which fitting manager breaks after first mission

June 07, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Rewritten fitting manager
	 - *New* Ship manager
	 - Ship and fitting names are no longer case sensitive
			=Fitting Manager:
				* If "Default" faction fitting is not specified, or is not found in the fitting browser, fitting
			 		manager is disabled.
				* If there is a <missionfitting> entry that matches the mission, the settings in that entry override
					the entry in <factionfitting>
				* If there are multiple <missionfitting> entries for a given mission, questor tries to match the 
					faction as well.  If there is no entry for the proper faction, goes with the first listed entry.
				* If there is a <missionfitting> entry, but there is no fitting specified (only a ship specified),
					the <factionfitting> entry is used.
				* If the fitting is not found in the fitting browser, the default fitting is used.  An omni-tank
					is highly recommended.
			
			=Ship Manager:
				* Ship can be specified on a per-mission basis via the ship="" flag in <missionfitting>
				* If the specified ship cannot be found, switches to the default combat ship and the default
					fitting
				* If the ship is found but the specified fitting is for another ship type, one of two things happens:
					- If the ship is the default combat ship, the default fitting is used
					- If the ship is not the default combat ship, the fitting is not changed and the current loadout
						is kept.

			=Both the ship="" and the fitting="" entries in <missionfitting> are optional.  If neither is specified,
				obviously the missionfitting has no effect.

June 04, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Bugfix to resolve crash if factionfittings not defined in xml

June 01, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Merged Da_Teach's Incursion 1.6 fix to DirectEve.dll
	 - Fixed bug that would cause the agent standings check to crash on international systems

May 30, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Added in code to check for acceleration gates during salvage because pockets didn't despawn
		 on mission turn-in.  bool <useGatesInSalvage> in char.xml determines behavior when gates
		 detected; if false, Questor salvages any ships in first pocket, then quits salvaging and
		 returns to base.  If true, Questor salvages, then proceeds through the gates, salvaging as
		 it goes.
	 - Attempt to fix issue with the Questor window occasionally disappearing, leaving Questor running
		 but with no ability to control it.
	

May 28, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Merged in Ganondorf's fitting swap code
		= Be sure to set up a "default" fitting in the fitting manager; this will be what is used
			if no fitting specified
		= fittings are specified in <charname>.xml.  Examples are given in the included charname.xml
			sample file
		= Mission specific fittings that also match the enemy faction are given highest priority.
			Next comes mission specific fittings that have no attached faction
			Next comes faction specific fittings
			Finally, if no other fittings matched, the default fitting is used
	 - Fixed swap code to switch to default if it can't find the specified fitting

May 27, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
	 - Revamped last changes to scheduler
		= Scheduler now reads <Schedules.xml> to get start, stop, and run times
		= Command line is back to normal behavior by default; if only one argument specified,
			assumes it's character name and checks <Schedules.xml> for a schedule for that
			character
	 - <Schedules.xml>
		= MUST have user, pw, and name defined or will not log in
		= Times should be military time in HH:MM format
		= If start is not specified, starts immediately
		= If current time is past start time by less than 12 hours, starts immediately;
			otherwise waits for start time to roll around again
		= If stop time comes before start time (i.e. start = 21:00, stop = 05:45), stop time
			occurs the next day
		= If runtime is specified, it overrides stop time and starts from the time Questor is
			actually started. (if start = 21:00, stop = 05:45, runtime = 4, and we run Questor
			at 22:15, Questor will start immediately and run for 4 hours, quitting at first idle
			state after 02:15 next morning)
		= Currently you can only have one schedule per character; you can't start and stop each
			character multiple times per day.  By "currently", I mean "for the forseeable future",
			as I have no pressing need to run my characters multiple times, I'm lazy, and I can't
			be arsed to work multiple schedules into the code.
		

May 21, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
    - Added command-line start time, stop time, and runtime.
    - Changed the existing command line args; new args:
		= -user <username>
		= -pw <password>
		= -char <character name>
		= -start <start time>
		= -stop <stop time>
		= -run <runtime in hours>
		Old command line of <user> <pw> <char> <autorun> will no longer work!
		Theoretically, start and stop times can be in any format recognizable
		 by DateTime.Parse.  I've been using military time in HH:MM and have
		 had no problems.
		Currently, if start time is more than 12 hours out, bot assumes we
		 missed the start time and starts immediately.  If we've already passed
		 the stop time, bot adds a day to the stop time.
		Once stop time is reached, bot will quit upon next idle state


March 11, 2011:
  * Changes/Fixes to Questor:
    
    - Added mission decline delay timer.  <char>.xml toggle is
      <waitDecline>true</waitDecline>

    - Added faction blacklist. Faction blacklist in <char>.xml is
      <factionblacklist>
           <faction>Caldari State</faction>
           <faction>Gallente Federation</faction>
           <faction>Whatever Else</faction>
      </factionblacklist>
